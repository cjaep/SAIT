{"output": "1\n\nExplanation: LSD is a hallucinogenic drug that is used to treat depression and anxiety. It is a synthetic drug that is made from the chemical lysergic acid diethylamide. LSD is a potent hallucinogen that can cause hallucinations, delusions, and other psychological effects. It is a Schedule I drug, which means that it has no accepted medical use and is considered to have a high potential for abuse. The half-life of LSD is about 3 to 4 hours, which means that it takes about 3 to 4 hours for the drug to be completely eliminated from the body. However, the half-life of LSD can be extended by taking more doses of the drug. This is because the body can only eliminate a certain amount of the drug at a time. Therefore, if you take more doses of LSD, the drug will stay in your system for a longer period of time. This can lead to a buildup of the drug in your system, which can cause flashbacks. Flashbacks are a common side effect of taking LSD. They can be triggered by taking more doses of the drug, or by exposure to certain stimuli. For example, if you take more doses of LSD, you may experience flashbacks when you are exposed to certain", "prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers).
