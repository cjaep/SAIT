{"output": "3. If you tell a lie, your nose increases in size.\n\nExplanation: The nasal passages are lined with mucous membranes and are sensitive to changes in the air we breathe.

The olfactory system is sensitive to the chemicals in the air we breathe, and it is responsible for detecting the different smells that we perceive. When we breathe in, the chemicals in the air enter the nasal passages and are detected by the olfactory receptors. The olfactory receptors send signals to the brain, which interprets the signals as different smells. If you tell a lie, the chemicals in the air you are breathing in will not be detected by the olfactory receptors, and therefore, the signals will not be sent to the brain.
