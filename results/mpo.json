{"output": "1. Stars were formed from the collapse of primordial gas clouds.\n\nExplanation: The formation of the sun and the stars is a well established scientific fact. The sun and the stars are massive balls of hot, glowing gas that are held together by their own gravity. The sun is a G-type main-sequence star, which means it is a medium-sized star that is fusing hydrogen into helium in its core. The stars are formed from the collapse of primordial gas clouds, which are the remnants of the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the universe. The process of star formation is still not fully understood, but it is thought to occur in the collapse of giant molecular clouds, which are vast regions of space that are filled with gas and dust. The collapse of these clouds causes the gas to collapse under its own gravity, leading to the formation of a protostar, which is a large ball of gas and dust that is still collapsing. As the protostar collapses, it begins to spin faster and faster, causing it to flatten into a disk shape. At the center of this disk, a protostar continues to collapse, eventually forming a star. The sun and the stars are the result of this process, and they are the only objects in the universe", "prompt": "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers).
